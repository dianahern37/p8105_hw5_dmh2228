Load libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

# Problem 1

Import the data.

```{r}
homicide_data =
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

The raw data has `r ncol(homicide_data)` variables and `r nrow(homicide_data)` observations. Some of the key variables include victim name, victim age, victim race, victim sex, city and state of homicide, and disposition. 

Create `city_state` variable and create summary.

```{r}
homicide_tidy =
  homicide_data |>
   mutate(
      city_state = paste(city,",", state)
    ) 
```
